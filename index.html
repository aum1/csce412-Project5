                            &emsp;I am a Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A&M University</a>, and am graduating in 2025. 
                        Learning coding from a young age fueled my ambition for computer science and am super interested in being one of the forerunners of the future. 
                        I am particularly interested in cybersecurity and data science, however, I have found a recent love for <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity Game Design</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://aggiecodingclub.com/">Aggie Coding Club</a> and <a href="https://www.aggiedatascience.com/">Aggie Data Science Club</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <!-- Add more about myself and how I would fit in the company -->
                            &emsp;I am someone who is hardworking, determined, adaptable, and meticulous. As someone who is hardworking, I spend extra time on tasks if I need to make my deadlines. I prioritize quality over deadlines, 
                        and hope to be able to ask for extensions in order to deliver top-tier code. That being said, I am also determined, in the sense that I work hard in order to make sure that I know what is needed, and work well under pressure.
                        While having loose requirements is not something that I enjoy, I can adapt and be able to ask questions in order to fully understand what I need to do. Needing changes is not something I struggle with and am willing to put in extra time in order to deliver.
                        Finally, I am also someone who is meticulous with my work. I pay attention to detail and try to make sure that spacing and code is written well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            &emsp;I loved working at <a href="https://www.sabre.com/">Sabre Corporation</a> last summer. The culture at Sabre appreciated people who wanted to go out of their way to develop.
                        Having a great culture at companies that I work at is really important to me. Being in a place where people are open and talk will 
                        help people be more appreciated and willing to contribute ideas. I really appreciate this, as it also means that people know each other's values, goals, and predicted ways to succeed.
                        I like being held accountable for my work, getting feedback, and fixing my code to a higher degree.
