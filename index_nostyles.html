                        &emsp;I am a Computer Science student at Texas A&M University, and am graduating in 2025. 
                        Learning coding from a young age fueled my ambition for computer science and am super interested in being one of the forerunners of the future. 
                        I am particularly interested in cybersecurity and data science, however, I have found a recent love for Unity game design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        &emsp;I grew up in Saratoga, California. I attended Saratoga High School, and graduated in 2021. I was a member of on-campus organizations, sports, and the band program. 
                        I swam for the swimming team for the first three years of high school. 
                        The band program was really where I shined. I was a member for all 4 years, and played flute, bassoon, and percussion. 
                        I was part of the manager team in junior year, and section leader for senior year. 
                        Since I played percussion, I joined and performed in Winter Percussion as well. At the senior ceremony for the band program, I was awarded the Director's Award. 
                        It was a specific award selected by the directors themselves, and was for leadership achievements and displays.

                        &emsp;Outside of school, I was also a soccer referee! I started volunteer refereeing for AYSO in 2014, since I played soccer. 
                        I started doing more and more games on the weekends, and chose to also sign up be a USSF referee, a paid position for competitive level soccer games. 
                        After some time, I also became an Intermediate AYSO referee, and have started preparing for the advanced AYSO certification.

                        &emsp;Following freshman year of college, I worked at an after-school program for kids called theCoderSchool. 
                        I started out being a normal coach, but gained a lot of experience and started becoming a higher-up coach. 
                        During my time there, I taught a variety of classes, including private classes, as well as group classes. 
                        I taught elementary to high school students about Java, Python, HTML, Scratch, Unity, Roblox Studio, and Minecraft Development.
                        </p>

                        &emsp;After my second year of college, I worked at Sabre Corportation as a Software Engineering Intern.
                        I developed in Java as part of the Digital Connect team, which worked as the gateway from front end to all the other API calls. 
                        More specifically, I worked on converting the monolith application to a microservices platform
                        and wrote wiremock test cases for a stateless payment service.
