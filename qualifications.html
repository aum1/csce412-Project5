                &emsp;Following freshman year of college, I worked at an after-school program for kids called <a href="https://www.thecoderschool.com/locations/southbay/#about">theCoderSchool</a>. I started out being a normal coach, but gained a lot of experience and started becoming a higher-up coach. During my time there, I taught a variety of classes, including private classes, as well as group classes. I taught elementary to high school students about Java, Python, HTML, Scratch, Unity, Roblox Studio, and Minecraft Development.  
                <br> 
                &emsp;After my sophomore year of college, I got the chance to prove my skills at Sabre Corporation, where I worked as a Software Engineer Intern. 
                I worked as part of the Digital Connect team, which was the layer between the front-end and API calls in the backend. Primarily, my focus was helping on converting the monolithic application into a microservices based one. Specifically, I worked on the Stateless Payment API, and wrote wiremock test cases for internal testing.
                <br>
                &emsp;I am interested in data science, software engineering to create products, and game design. 
                I have always thought that data science and machine learning is fascinating, especially when thinking about the future of computer science. Machine learning is an interesting concept that I would live to gain more knowledge about and plan to have Machine Learning be my focus in my future masters program.
                Seeing code and software engineering in society is very cool and something that I an interested in as well. Working at Sabre was a great experience as I was able to schedule flights and see code that I was working on be released to the public. I think that helping make software for others is an interesting way to help others be more connected to the modern world and have access to high-level software.
                As someone who plays a lot of video games, the concept of creating these entire worlds and stories from lines of code compelling, and draws me to the concept of creating games for others to also enjoy. I learned Unity when teaching for theCoderSchool, and now I enjoy making games that help me learn C# and the engine itself.
